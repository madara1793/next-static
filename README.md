# Next Static Blog
__‚ú® Start static then go server rendered when you need to ‚ú®__

A simple static blog powered by [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js).

## Before Using
This repo could be a good starting place for your simple Next.js powered static site. That said, there are other options out there that are more extensible, well maintained, and  battle tested than this repo. Check them out: https://myles.github.io/awesome-static-generators/

## Getting Started
* Fork this repo
* `yarn`
* Edit `config/index.js` to your liking. 
  * Get the best experience with config by adding a plugin to your text editor that will surface flow errors. This will ensure you're providing the expected types for your config values.
* `yarn dev`
* Write! üìù

## Writting
* Create a `.md` file in `posts`.
* Add front matter separated by `---` and the body of the post in markdown below:
<pre lang="yaml">
---
title: Title
slug: slug
author: Your Name
date: 2017-6-10 15:00 PDT
tags:
  - tags
  - go here
---
## Post
Use markdown to _write_ your post
Here's some code:
```javascript
const a = 'thing';
```
</pre>
* While writing, run `yarn dev` to see your post live reload when saved.
* Re-run `yarn export` to build your new site.

## Updating Next Static
Currently Next Static is not packaged an distributed on NPM. In order to receive updates you will need to do something like this:
* Inside the your fork `git remote add upstream git@github.com:infiniteluke/next-static.git`
* `git merge upstream master`
* To the extent that you hack Next Static, you will need to resolve merge conflicts.
* I'm open to ideas on how to best package this and make the update process as simple as bumping versions.
